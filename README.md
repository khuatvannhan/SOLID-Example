SOLID
	1: Single responsibility principle
		"A class should have one, and only one, reason to change".

	2: Open/Close Principle 
		“A class is closed, since it may be compiled, stored in a library, baselined, and used by client classes. But it is also open, since any new class may use it as parent, adding new features. When a descendant class is defined, there is no need to change the original or to disturb its clients.”

	3: Liskov Substitution Principle
		"Objects should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program"

	4: Interface Segregation Principle
		“Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use.”

	5: Dependency Inversion Principle
		"A. High level modules should not depend upon low level modules. Both should depend upon abstractions."
		"B. Abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend upon abstractions."
